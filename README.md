### [Flask Framework](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

[Flask](/what-is/flask) is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

### [What is a dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))

A dashboard is a set of pages that are easy to read and offer information to the user in real-time regarding his business. A dashboard usually consists of graphical representations of the current status and trends within an organization.
